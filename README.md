# SD2_Temple_Roboboat_FA21

A large roadblock for each of Temple’s Roboboat design iterations has been difficulty in achieving consistent control and connectivity. Usually, each team needs to juggle developing new boat hardware, control systems, and sophisticated autonomous algorithms for navigation. The main objective of this project is to design and develop a hardware and software platform that can be used by future Temple RoboBoat teams to validate and tune new autonomous Aquatic Surface Vehicle (ASV) designs. The team’s proposed solution includes three major pieces of hardware: a navigation controller, a R/C transmitter and receiver, and a physical test platform. Development of a control system software will enable future Temple University RoboBoat teams to focus their efforts on other aspects of autonomous ASV development without needing to develop custom control logic and manage sensor trafficking. Beyond participation in the RoboBoat competition, the ASV design and control software could also be used for data collection in local bodies of water.
